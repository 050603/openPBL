// Upload cleanup tasks (Stage 6).

// Three operations:
//   - cleanupOrphanFiles(): scan the uploads directory and remove any files
//     that have no UploadFile row in the database.
//   - cleanupCourseFiles(courseId): bulk-delete every upload belonging to a
//     course — disk files + DB rows. Used when a course is deleted.
//   - cleanupExpiredFiles(retentionDays): for courses whose status is
//     "finished", remove upload files older than `retentionDays` days.
